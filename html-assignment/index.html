     <h2>About Me</h2>
     <p>Hi to everyone reading this on my first website. My name is Olivia Norman and I'm a student at Algonquin College taking the Interactive Media Design program. How I came to be in this program is I had just finished my first ever college program and decided that I wanted to continue going to school. I made this decision when I realized that I wasn't in a good spot to get a job. I knew from my previous program that I had taken an extra interest in the video editing side of the film industry.</p>
     <p>If you were to compare me right now to the person I was during the first web development class, there would be a big difference.</p>
