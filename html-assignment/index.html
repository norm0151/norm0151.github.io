     <p>Hi to everyone reading this on my first website. My name is Olivia Norman and I'm a student at Algonquin College taking the Interactive Media Design program. How I came to be in this program is I had just finished my first ever college program and decided that I wanted to continue going to school. I made this decision when I realized that I wasn't in a good spot to get a job. I knew from my previous program that I had taken an extra interest in the video editing side of the film industry.</p>
     <p>If you were to compare me right now to the person I was during the first web development class, there would be a <em>big</em> difference. I am now very confident in coding even though I'm just learning the basics of it. When I first found out about web development being a class in this program, I was very intimidated. I remember I was also frustrated with it being a class in the first place because I kept thinking that <sup>this is going to be useless</sup> since I never had any interest in coding. Then again this program is called Interactive Media Design for a reason and I'm now happy to be learning code.</p>
